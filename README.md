# react-memo-two

In this project, you will practice using
the React.memo function to optimize performance
in a React application. React.memo is a
higher-order component that can be used to 
memoize functional components and prevent
unnecessary re-renders. By memoizing
components, you can improve the overall
performance of your application.

Step 1: Project Setup

-  Set up a new React project using Create
React App or any other preferred method.
-  Create a new component called
ParentComponent that will serve as the
parent container for the memoized component.

Step 2: Create the Memoized Component

-  Create a new functional component
called MemoizedComponent that represents
a component you want to memoize.
-  This component can have any functionality 
or render any content you desire for testing purposes.

Step 3: Wrap the Component with React.memo

-  Import the React.memo function from the React library.
Wrap the MemoizedComponent with the
React.memo function, like this:
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(OriginalComponent);.

Step 4: Render the Memoized Component

-  Render the MemoizedComponent inside
the ParentComponent JSX code.
-  Pass any necessary props to the MemoizedComponent.

Step 5: Observe the Performance

-  Start the development server and open
your application in the browser.
-  Use browser development tools or performance
monitoring tools to observe the rendering
behavior and performance of the memoized component.
-  Take note of any changes or
improvements in performance compared
to when the component was not memoized.

Step 6: Modify Props and Re-observe Performance

-  Modify the props being passed to the
MemoizedComponent in the ParentComponent.
-  Trigger a re-render of the ParentComponent
to observe how the memoized component
responds to prop changes.
-  Verify that the memoized component
does not re-render unnecessarily when
props that don't affect its output are changed.

Step 7: Test Different Scenarios

-  Test the memoized component in various
scenarios by changing props,
triggering updates, or simulating
different user interactions.
-  Observe how the memoized component
performs and determine if it
effectively prevents unnecessary re-renders.

Step 8: Performance Optimization Analysis

-  Analyze the performance improvements 
achieved by using React.memo in your application.
-  Compare the rendering behavior and 
performance metrics before and after
implementing memoization.
-  Document and summarize the improvements
you observed in terms of rendering times,
CPU utilization, or other
relevant performance indicators.

Step 9: Documentation and Learning

-  Document your findings and observations
regarding the usage of React.memo
and its impact on performance.
-  Reflect on the scenarios where memoization
is most effective and situations where it
may not provide significant benefits.
-  Note any limitations or considerations
to keep in mind when using React.memo
in your future projects.
